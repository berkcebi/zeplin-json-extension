# JSON Design Tokens Zeplin Extension

Generates design tokens in JSON, for colors and text styles. ðŸ—‚

Regardless of which tool the designs are exported from, this extension lets you export JSON files from colors and text styles defined in Zeplin projects and styleguides. Based on internal needs, developers can transform these JSON files and generate code snippets or resources for various platforms.

Sample colors output:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "yellow",
    "red": 254,
    "green": 207,
    "blue": 51,
    "alpha": 1
  },
  {
    "name": "lightOrange",
    "red": 253,
    "green": 189,
    "blue": 57,
    "alpha": 1
  }
]
```

Sample text style output:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Normal",
    "color": {
      "red": 87,
      "green": 71,
      "blue": 81,
      "alpha": 1
    },
    "letterSpacing": 1,
    "lineHeight": 32,
    "alignment": "left",
    "font": {
      "postscriptName": "SFProDisplay-Regular",
      "family": "SFProDisplay",
      "size": 26,

    }
